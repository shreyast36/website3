<h2>Here are the list of projects we have completed/planned so far</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>CoMIS</b></li>
  <p>CoMIS is a business case competition held annually at the Carlson School of Management in the University of Minnesota. Students will work in a team to engineer a unique and creative solution to a business case study. Before the competition, interested participants are required to give an individual timed speech in front of a panel of industrial judges, who will critique and assess the students based on their skills. The remaining participants form the team that goes on to represent the University at the actual competition.
  </p>
  <li><b>Employer Roundtable</b></li>
  <p>An employer roundtable is where employers from different sectors come together in one room to meet the students. This past year, we were able to secure visits from employers such as Bank of America. The individuals representing these firms interacted fully with each of the respective students. This meant potential networking opportunities for students. More specifically, the employees were extremely helpful in sharing their expertise and experience with us. They gave us insights into their jobs and told us what skills that we would be required to acquire in order to be successful at the jobs.
This was a fully interactive event for students.</p>
  <li><b>Outreach</b></li>
   <p>We plan on going to different schools within the DFW Area and educating the students on the ITS Program. Work in progress</p>
